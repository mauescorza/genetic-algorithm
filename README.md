# genetic-algorithm
This is a Python program that uses a genetic algorithm to solve the famous "8 Queens Problem." The objective of the problem is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no queen attacks another (i.e., no queen shares a row, column, or diagonal with another queen).

The program creates an initial population of 50 potential solutions represented as chromosomes. Then, it utilizes the genetic algorithm to evolve and improve the solutions over several generations until it finds a valid solution or a solution that minimizes conflicts between the queens.
